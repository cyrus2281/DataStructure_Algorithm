# DataStructure_Algorithm
This repository contains my notes for data structure and algorithm.
Currently they are mostly reminders and important notes and sample codes, but I will come back to these and make them understandable for beginners too.
The notes are written in Jupyter Notebook, and thus in python.
The built version of the notes are also available in html.


These files are also hosted on:
