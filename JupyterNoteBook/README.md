# JupyterNoteBook

This section contains my notes for data structure and algorithm.
These notes are all written in Jupyter Notebook using Python 3. (For other languages check the other 2 sections)
These notes include sample codes and important notes. They are not meant for learning the subject, but they can be very help for a refresher and quick lookups.

These notes are also exported as HTML for easier access. the HTML hosted version can be found at:
